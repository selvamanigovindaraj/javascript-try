Local storage 
- Local storage stores the data in the form of object
- The data is stored for longer duration and remains in the browser unless user delete it explicitly, it remains even after computer restart 
- No way to specify the time out period as the Cookies have 
- Good to create offline application that runs in the client machine (browser) 
- Local storage data is not sent to the server on every request (HTTP header) as it is purely at the client side 

Cookies 
- Good for small amount of data  
- All data is transferred to and from server, so bandwidth is consumed on every request 
- Can specify timeout period so that cookies data are removed from browser 

1....Since 'undefined' is a reserved word in js so it will log undefined


2.....when undefined is add with number it will NaN;


3.....Alert1 is 10 since it is declared 
        Alert2 is 100 Because in local Scope which is declared inside a function block
        Alert3 is also 10 It is not 100 Because 100 is declared locally inside a function with a prefix of var 
        so it won't affect the global variable 'a=10';

5.....I compared the array lenth first and started to iterate based on index and compared both type and value 
        so i can able to check whether it is equal..;

7....I find 'button' using a tagName method And added a event handler using 'addEventListener'.since tagName method
    returns array So I used the  array index to find button
